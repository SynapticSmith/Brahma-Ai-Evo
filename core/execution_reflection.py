============================
Brahma AI - Self-Correction & Execution Reflection Engine.

Provides autonomous verification and diagnostic self-healing for tool executions:
1. Verifies physical state changes after actions execute (e.g., RAM dropped, process spawned, port open).
2. Diagnoses root causes of failures (permissions, offline targets, syntax mismatches).
3. Automatically triggers fallback strategies to heal execution without user frustration.
4. Synthesizes clear, actionable explanations instead of cryptic stack traces.
